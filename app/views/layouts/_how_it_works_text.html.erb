      <h3>Redeemer:</h3>
      <li>
        Register as a redeemer, then log in anytime to see if there are any redeemables you’d like to pick up for cash.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once you’ve claimed a job by clicking the box next to the listing, you are responsible for that pickup.
      </li>
      <li>
        The listing will disappear so that another redeemer cannot claim the same job.
      </li>
      <li>
        You’ll have 24 hours to remove that user’s recycling. Please be courteous - do not claim a job unless you intend to pick it up within that time frame!
      </li>
      <li>
        Lastly, to remove the bubble from your map you must check the “complete” box for each job. This will trigger a text to the recycler to let them know this transaction is complete.
      </li>
    </p>

      <h3>Recycler:</h3>

      <li>
        Register as a recycler, then log in anytime to request a redeemer to pick up your recycling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Only registered redeemers will be able to see this information and claim the job.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once a redeemer has clicked the box next to your listing, you’ll be notified by text message and email.
      </li>
      <li>
        They’ll have 24 hours to remove your bags.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don’t forget to take your bags of redeemables outside!
      </li>
      <li>
        Please be courteous - put the bags somewhere visible on your property and make sure it’s obvious for your redeemer.
      </li>
