## How it works:

### Recycler:
* Register as a recycler, then log in anytime to request a redeemer to pick up your recycling.

* Only registered redeemers will be able to see this information and claim the job.

* Once a redeemer has claimed your pickup, you’ll be notified by text message and email.

* They’ll have 24 hours to remove your bags.

* Don’t forget to take your bags of redeemables outside!

* Please be courteous - put the bags somewhere visible on your property and make sure it’s obvious for your redeemer.

### Redeemer:
* Register as a redeemer, then log in anytime to see if there are any redeemables you’d like to pick up for cash.

* Once you’ve claimed a job by clicking the box next to the listing, you are responsible for that pickup. You’ll have 24 hours to remove that user’s recycling. Please be courteous - do not claim a job unless you intend to pick it up within that time frame!

* The listing will disappear so that another redeemer cannot claim the same job.

* To remove the bubble from your map you must check the “complete” box for each job. This will trigger a text to the recycler to let them know the transaction is complete.
